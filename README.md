## EXPERIENCE

### Sr. iOS Developer

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Alaska Airlines, SeaTac, Sep 2022 – Apr 2024**

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bag Tag Station - Inhouse app for printing bag tags at the airport

The app was created to help guest traveling on AA print their bag tag at the airport for checked-in bags, they can print pre-paid bags or add new bags and pay with the point of sale attached to the iPad kiosk
We deployed the app to around 87 airports across the US, 3 cities in Mexico, and a couple in South America, for a close total of 480 stations.

  <details>
  <summary>All details</summary>
    
  * When arriving in Alaska I started working on small production bugs related to UI issues
  
  * Immediately after I started working on the implementation of tracking the app with AppDynamics, logging information from the app like location, usage, iPadOS Data, printing events, disconnections from the internet, as well as triggered events from the logs that will help us acknowledge issues and figure out solutions to restore the service
  
  * Implemented new Sumo Logic logs to store big chunks of data related to the Flights and guest data, personal info, contact information, flight records, Reservation codes, and segment flights. This data helps us create dashboards and charts to see important details, like the number of printer bag tags, payments, usage of each station, as well as successful and failed payments, error API call rates, email alerts
  
  * I also worked with the Survey Team to implement a survey link for the guests to give feedback about the usage of the Station via Qualtrics, the app will show a button asking if the guest would like to answer a survey via email. We used that information later to create dashboards on Tableau
  
  * I implemented feature flags with Optimizely to enable different features based on location on the Device Name
  
  * We had deployments of stations at new airports every 2 or 3 months and every time there was a deployment of the kiosk I had to add each new device to our monitoring system, adding devices to Sumo and AppD making sure we had the correct Alerts and Dashboards for our stations
  
  * We have app updates or code deployments every 2 weeks using Workspace 1 and Microsoft ADO pipeline to create builds, with the latest iOS updates
  
  * Slowly updating Swift Code to SwiftUI for some of the classes
  
  * The team consists of 3 iOS developers, 1 Backend Go Developer, 1 Scrum master, 1 Tech lead, 1 Product Manager, and 2 UI/UX researchers
  
  * Constant communication with the prod ops field team for managing installation issues and also with the Alaska agents located at each airport for solving app issues and getting tickets for production bugs
  
  * We worked on a 2 weeks sprint schedule

### Sr. iOS Developer

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Gap Inc., San Francisco, Nov 2019 – Jul 2022**

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sell App - POS for Gap Stores

The app was created as a POS for the Gap Stores
Gap Associates can use an iPod to charge clients who buy products and want to pay with a Credit Card, Debit Card, or NFC connection via phone or card
If the client wants to pay with cash, the client will need to reach the Cashier Associate with the version of the app for iPad, this version is connected to a cashier where the money can be stored but also products can be paid with credit/debit via Terminal Payment (PIN PAD)
Another variation of the app, recently implemented, was the Self Check, clients can go to a Self Check Kiosk, scan their own products, select the type of card, and type the Security PIN on the Payment terminal, this kiosk is not available for cash payments

  <details>
  <summary>All details</summary>
    
  * When arriving at Gap the app was coded in Swift 5.1 using Xcode 11 and iOS 11, along the way the code was updated to newer versions of Swift, Xcode, and iOS, the latest update was Swift 5.6, using Xcode 13.1 and iOS 15
  
  * The app allows the associate to serve as a point of sale for the clients, depending on how the client wants to pay, the app could work on iPod or iPad
  
  * The iPod version was connected to a case where the user could use any type of Card to make a payment
  
  * On another hand, the iPad version was in case the user wanted to pay with cash or even a credit card, the app was connected to a cashier and a PIN Pad Terminal
  
  * Another important feature of the app is the Self Check Kiosk, the clients are able to do self-checkout by scanning their own product without an associate, they can apply coupons and discount codes, apply for credit card and loyalty enrollment programs, return products, send receipts via email and print them as well
  
  * I worked on several features across the entire app like discount codes, redeem coupons, transactions, print receipts, Credit Card enrollment, Loyalty program enrollment, scanning SKU products, tax calculation for different countries, Localization for English (US Market), Spanish (Puerto Rico Market) and French (Canada Market), CT Communication (Pin pad), Sales Reports, Returns, Suspend Transaction, Unit Testing, contract testing with Pact Stuby, and UI Tests with Docker
  
  * The app uses different UI resources to display screens like Storyboards, XIBs, Custom Views, Storyboard References, and views created programmatically
  
  * The use of Cocoa-pods was essential for the development of the app, for example, the reusability of several UI elements (Gap UI) shared across different Gap apps, Device Communication, (GapDevices), Logs, (GapLogger, GapMonitoring, and GapUtilities), as well as 3rd party frameworks like SwiftyJSON, SwiftXMLParser, PactConsumerSwift, and ISO8601, among others
  
  * GDC and NSOperationQueue were used to control the multithreading activities of the app
  
  * RESTFul services with JSON and XML parsing
  
  * Singleton, Delegates, Observers, and Publisher-subscribers arearchitecture methodologies constantly used to build this app
  
  * Github as the source control platform is used to store the code and Jenkins is used as the CICD system
  
  * The team is integrated by 10 iOS devs, 4 QA, 2 Tech Leads, 2 Productions QAs, 1 scrum master, and usually 1 PDM per feature, with 2 weeks sprint for delivering features
  
  * Constant communication with other teams inside Gap like the Service Team, Pipeline Team, and Pods Team, as well as 3rd party teams and companies like Verifone for CT implementation and Barclays Dev Team for processing Payments
